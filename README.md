### Hi there 👋

🎨 Frontend Developer & Graphic Designer extraordinaire here! I'm Hephzibah A, and I'm all about turning pixels into magic. With a blend of code and creativity, I specialize in crafting sleek interfaces and eye-catching designs that make users go "wow!"

💻 Armed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, and a dash of Figma magic, I'm on a mission to create digital experiences that leave a lasting impression. From wireframes to final products, I've got you covered every step of the way.

🖌️ When I'm not wrangling code, you can find me lost in the world of Adobe Illustrator or sketching away on Procreate. Whether it's digital or traditional, I believe in the power of art to inspire and transform.

🚀 Let's collaborate and bring your ideas to life! Drop me a line at hephzibahantony11@gmail.com and let's make some digital dreams a reality.
